# Gabriele Russo's assignment for the Research Track 2 course (Mat. 5180813)

## Introduction
The assignment of the Research Track 2 consist of transforming the user interface node of the Third assignment of the Research Track 1 course in a Jupyter Notebook.

You can find the report and the whole third assignment in this [repository](https://github.com/GabrieleRusso11/rt1_third_assignment).

You can also read a very detailed documentation of the code, at the following link:

https://gabrielerusso11.github.io/RT2_assignment/

## How to run this new version
Talking about the requirements and the installations needed to run the project, you can read directly the [Third assignment documentation](https://github.com/GabrieleRusso11/rt1_third_assignment).
Then you need to download the 'rt2_assignment.launch' from the launch folder of the current repository and for this new version you need the following command line to run the project:

```
roslaunch rt1_third_assignment rt2_assignment.launch
```

Since, the user interface now is a Jupyter notebook, you also need to open your jupyter application and run the cell of the following [notebook](https://github.com/GabrieleRusso11/RT2_assignment/blob/main/User_Interface_Russo_Gabriele.ipynb).

## DEMO
In this section I would like to add a short video that shows the new version of the user interface powered by the jupyter notebook
